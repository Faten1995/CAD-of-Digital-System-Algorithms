# CAD-of-Digital-System-Algorithms
These are the algorithms that have been designed during the course work of Digital Systems Algorithms course for my Masters work

Must algorithms are based on open-source work that have been modifed to fit the course requirments and test cases. In addition, all algorithms are designed to have similar objects structure to enhance the readibility.

All algorithms are written in Python and they have not been validated. Use them as a starting point not as a major refrence. 

Thanks,
